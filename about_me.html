					I was born in California, but raised Texan for most of my life.
					It's easy to see why I've chosen to pursue Computer Engineering
					as my field of study when you consider things such as that I've
					been using computers since I was 3 years old, was the kid who
					took robotics classes, and taught myself how to develop Android
					apps (although I've never released one on the app store [yet]).<br><br>
					
					Besides these more nerdy pursuits, I also enjoy activities
					outside of school, such as playing guitar, going out two-stepping,
					working out, spending time outdoors, and going to the gun range.<br><br>
					
					Oddly enough, I enjoy programming for one of the same reasons that I enjoy
					learning guitar - it's a challenge. I have to be resourceful, which is a
					skill I've been developing more and more my whole life. A good example of
					that is how I've been self-teaching guitar with help from

					this guy's awesome videos</a>.
