					A big part of my life is giving back where others have given to me, whether it's helping out at <a href="http://www.antiochcs.org/">my church, Antioch</a>,
					or it's in regard to community service like volunteering at a food pantry or participating in <a href="https://bigevent.tamu.edu/">Big Event</a>.
					<br><br>
					In regard to my church, I serve week-to-week as a Lifegroup leader. In this role, along with my co-leaders,
					I get to organize a weekly house church. I actively participate in group meetings, coordinate assignments,
					organize Bible study, and lead times of fellowship. It's a ton of fun and I enjoy being able to make the
					same positive impact on others that was made on me when I first started going. Additionally, serving in
					this capacity has given me a chance to develop my skills as a leader and to build my confidence in open
					teamwork and communication, especially in front of large groups!
					<br><br>
					In regard to community service, at A&amp;M I participate in the yearly Big Event service project. For this
					event we take a day out of the Spring semester, organize a team, and go to someone's home within the local
					community to help them with landscaping, painting, or any odd-jobs they need help with. Besides Big Event,
					I have spent many hours helping out at a food pantry back home in North Austin, called the <a href="https://revealresourcecenter.com/">Reveal Resource
					Center</a>. During high school, I would go up there every morning before class and help distribute food and
					clothing to those in need. Both of these experiences have given me a much greater appreciation for people
					and for the need to be able to understand and sympathize with them, no matter what stage of life or
					circumstances they are in. (Pssst, that's me below on the far right!)
